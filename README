In order to run this assignment, all you have to do is run main.py. Inside main.py there are seven functions. These
functions are: get_data(), ClusterTuning(), ClusterAnalysis(), ReductionAnalysis(), ReductionClusteringAnalysis(),
ReductionNNAnalysis(), and ReductionClusteringNNAnalysis(). get_data() simply retrieves the data and prepares the data
for use in the project. The rest of the funtions serve to complete portions of the project and are performed in the
order listed. ClusterTuning() tunes the kmeans and expectation maximum cluster algorithms. ClusterAnalysis() then
analyzes each of the tuned clustering algorithms. ReductionAnalysis() analyzes the four reduction techniques utilized.
ReductionClusteringAnalysis() analyzes the clustering algorithms when the reduction is used prior. ReductionNNAnalysis()
analyzes the NN when reduction is first performed. Finally, ReductionClusteringNNAnalysis() analyzes the NN when the
input includes the clustering outcome after reduction was first performed. In order to run all of these, simply run
main.py. Simply comment out the function you would not like to run to skip one.

Inside this project folder is also a data folder containing the data for both the income and music problems.

The rest of the files are images produced by running the analyses functions listed out above and will be reproduced each
time the functions are run.
